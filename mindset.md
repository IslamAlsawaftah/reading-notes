## The power of believing that you can improve
Carol Dweck

## Grit: The power of passion and perseverance
Angela Lee Duckworth
##### grit is having stamina, living life like a marathon
##### mindset growth: is the belief thet the ability to learn is not fixed,it can change with your effort, failure is not a permanent condition, we need to take our best ideas,our strongest intuitions we need to test them, we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned 

## A kinder, gentler philosophy of success
Alain de Botton

#####  anyone can achieve anything. We've done away with the caste system, we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please spirit of equality; we're all basically equal. There are no strictly defined hierarchies. 

##### what is a meritocratic society? A meritocratic society is one in which, if you've got talent and energy and skill, you will get to the top, nothing should hold you back. It's a beautiful idea. The problem is, if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top, get to the top, you'll also, by implication, and in a far more nasty way, believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there. In other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental, but merited and deserved. And that makes failure seem much more crushing.

##### hold your horses when you're coming to judge people
##### You can't be successful at everything.  The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them, and that somehow the crueler the environment, the more people will rise to the challenge.
